In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors are also required to:  properly select and apply accounting policies;  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and under- standable information; and  provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entitys financial position and financial performance. 28 Statement of Director Responsibilities In the case of UK GAAP financial statements, the directors are required to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are also required to:  select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;  make judgements that are reasonable and prudent; and  state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed. The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any  time the financial position of the company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of a directors report and directors remuneration report which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 1985. The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. Fulmar plc    Annual Report & Accounts 2005 29 Directors Remuneration Report THE DIRECTORS REMUNERATION REPORT Regulations 2002 require the auditors to report to the companys members on the auditable part of the directors remuneration report and to state whether in their opinion that part of the report has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Regulations). All information relating to the auditable part of the report is shown in note 4 to the accounts. In all other respects the report contains unaudited information. Information about the emoluments and share options of the directors is given in note 4 to the accounts.',\n",
